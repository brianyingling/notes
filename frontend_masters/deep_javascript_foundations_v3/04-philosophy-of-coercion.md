## Intentional Coercion
"You don't deal with these type conversion corner cases by avoiding coercions." - Kyle Simpson

"You have to adopt a coding style that makes value types plain and obvious"

"A quality JS program embraces coercions, making sure the types involved in every operation are clear. Thus, corner cases are safely managed."

Can learn these systems, you don't need to jump to TypeScript

"JavaScript's dynamic typing is not a weakness, it's one of its strong qualities." - Kyle Simpson

## Culture of Learning
Everyone is capable of learning JavaScript's coercion system 
"But...but what about the Junior Devs" - Junior devs can learn this!

## Implicit Coercion
Implicit != Magic
Implicit != Bad
Implicit: Abstracted

"We want to hide unnecessary details, refocusing the reader and increasing clarity." - Kyle Simpson

Implicit can be good (sometimes)

## Understanding Features
"If a feature is sometimes useful and sometimes dangerous and if there is a better option then always use the better option." - Douglas Crockford, "JavaScript: The Good Parts"
